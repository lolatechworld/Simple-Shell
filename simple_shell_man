hsh [options] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The term "Shell" in UNIX refers to the interactive interface between a user and an operating system. It serves as the programming layer responsible for comprehending and executing user-entered commands. In certain systems, it may be referred to as a command interpreter. Typically, a shell denotes an interface featuring a specific command syntax. 

.B Overview

The simple shell is a command that processes lines from a file or the terminal, interprets them, and typically runs other commands. It initiates when a user logs into the system and offers various features to enhance interactive usage. Its benefit lies in using a shared interpretative language for both interactive sessions and non-interactive use (shell scripts). This means commands can be directly typed into the active basic shell or written into a file, which can then be executed directly by the basic shell.

.SH Return Value

The simple shell always returns a 0 for success, another number means failure.

.SH PATH

It will look inside all directions in the PATH env variable for executable.
