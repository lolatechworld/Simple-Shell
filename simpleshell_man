.SH DESCRIPTION
The term "Shell" in UNIX refers to the interactive interface between a user and an operating system. It serves as the programming layer responsible for comprehending and executing user-entered commands. In certain systems, it may be referred to as a command interpreter. Typically, a shell denotes an interface featuring a specific command syntax.

.PP
.B Overview
The simple shell is a command that processes lines from a file or the terminal, interprets them, and typically runs other commands. It initiates when a user logs into the system and offers various features to enhance interactive usage. Its benefit lies in using a shared interpretative language for both interactive sessions and non-interactive use (shell scripts). This means commands can be directly typed into the active basic shell or written into a file, which can then be executed directly by the basic shell.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The simple shell always returns 0 for success; another number indicates failure.

.SH PATH
It will look inside all directories in the PATH environment variable for executables.

.SH OPTIONS
.B simple_shell
Command options will be typed after the main command, followed by a space and a '-' symbol.

.SH EXAMPLE
[command] [options]
$ ls -l

.SH BUGS
Single space required after an argument.
